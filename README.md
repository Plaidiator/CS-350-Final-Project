# CS-350-Final-Project

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving
The goal of this project was to create a prototype thermostat program on a TI CC3220s. The left and right buttons on the board were used to increase or decrease the set temperature, and the integrated temperature sensor was used to tell the program what the temperature of the room is. When the set point was set above the current temperature, a light on the board would illuminate, indicating a heater being turned on. To simulate cloud communication, the device output the temperature, setpoint, input status, and time once every second. 

### What did you do particularly well?
I am proud of this program overall. I think that it efficiently completes the necessary task. Minimal board resources are used and the code is clean and tidy. 

### Where could you improve?
I ran into a few issues while creating this code. I think that I could improve my debugging speed. Working with and debugging a microcontroller was a new experience and I know that more experience will help this.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I referenced the textbook for this class quite a bit, so I have that as a new resource for development.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
This class was my first experience writing code for a single-board system. I have gained a new understanding of drivers and using them for improving functionality. I also have a better understanding of resource management since these microcontrollers have significantly less ram then regular computers.  

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I created clear blocks of code with individual functions. I also commented throughout to make interpreting my code easy. The code is neatly formatted to make adding new features simple to integrate.
